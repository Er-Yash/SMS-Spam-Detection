We need a way to represent text data for machine learning algorithm and the bag-of-words model helps us to achieve that task. 
we use the tokenized words for each observation and find out the frequency of each token.
Using this process  , we  convert this collection of documents to a matrix, with each document being a row and each word(token) being the column,
and the corresponding (row,column) values being the frequency of occurrence of each word or token in that document.
